# Computer Graphics, exercise 2

The purpose of this exercise is to implement a ray tracer. A text file is given as input, 
describing a 3D scene with objects inside it. From this data a 3D scene would be modeled in-memory, and then a ray tracing
algorithm is applied, in order to find the scene's projection on a 2D plane that's present in the scene. This plane simbolizes
the user's field of view, so the projection is processed into a 2D image which is rendered in an OpenGL window.
